\vspace{0.65cm}

A short summary of your thesis, describing the background, your objectives and the most important outcomes, it may also include some of the conclusions of your thesis. 
This template gives an example of how you may organize your thesis, which can be a challenge in itself considering the scope of the project that you now are embarking on. Bear in mind that it is only a suggestion, and that you should adapt this template in the way that you think suits your thesis the best. This template is based on the structure of completed master theses of high standard. The formatting applied to this template is an ex-ample of how you should format your thesis (e.g. use of headings, tables that you need to include etc.)
