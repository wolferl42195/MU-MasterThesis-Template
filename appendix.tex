\chapter{\textsc{Appendices}}
\label{chap:app}

Appendices contain material that is too large for inclusion in the text or would interrupt the flow of the presentation if it were to be cited in detail. Such texts include the minutes of a meeting, questionnaires, interview outlines and records and the like. References to material in the appendix are indicated by the word appendix and a capital letter beginning with A in the reference sequence in the text. Each appendix begins on a new sheet.
