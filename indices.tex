\chapter{\textsc{Bibliography Description}}
\label{chap:bibliography}

Use APA (American Psychology Association) style formatting for your references. The guide-lines for how to do this can be found at \url{http://www.apastyle.org/}.

The bibliography at the end of the paper contains the necessary information for the read-er so that he/she can identify the sources cited in the paper and be able to find them in the library. Only the works that are referred to in the text should be included in the bibliography. Each source referenced in the text must be listed in the bibliography and vice-versa. Therefore, one must carefully examine whether each reference is presented in both places and that the source referenced in the text corresponds with its presentation in the bibliography. Data from the bibliography must be cited by means of a uniform method of citation and in alphabetical order. The bibliography should be single spaced. The first line in the reference should have a normal position; any consecutive lines should be indented (see examples below). A possible way of organizing citation of the sources from the bibliography could look like this:
